### Task Estimation

First of all, before any planning for the realization of a project, there is necessarily an estimation stage. The evaluation of the realization of a task can be based on different notions such as man-days, hours, points or even t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL...).

1. **Agile | Scrum** estimation concept

During a **Agile or Scrum** estimate, all the people who can bring something to the project are invited and involved. This allows everyone to express their point of view and thus obtain a much broader vision of the functionality to be estimated and the solutions that can be implemented. The responsibility for the estimation is shared equally among all team members and is not attributable If the estimation is incorrect, the whole team is responsible. Everyone will therefore become more involved and will not be afraid to express their opinion.

These estimates are based on a compromise between project team members. This is not an activity that brings real added value to the project, so it should take as little time as possible. This is why an agile estimate will never be expressed in man-days, hours or even euros. It is a qualitative estimate and not a quantitative one. We will estimate the complexity of a task, based on experience and similar tasks.

The complexity of the accomplishment of a task will be measured using a qualitative unit, usually a number of points. This greatly simplifies the estimation. To summarize, in an Agile or Scrum estimation, a difficulty is estimated in number of points based on references and experience on similar tasks previously performed.

2. The different **methods** of task estimation

There are several agile estimation methods, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Nothing prevents the team from changing estimation methods every sprint until they find the one that best suits your agile team.
