### Task Estimation

First of all, before any planning for the realization of a project, there is necessarily an estimation stage. The evaluation of the realization of a task can be based on different notions such as man-days, hours, points or even t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL...).

1. **Agile | Scrum** estimation concept

During an agile estimation, all the people who can bring something to the project are invited and involved. This allows everyone to express their point of view and thus obtain a much broader vision of the functionality to be estimated and the solutions that can be implemented. The responsibility for the estimation is equally shared between all team members and not attributable to one single person. If the estimate is incorrect, the entire team is responsible. Everyone will therefore become more involved and will not be afraid to express their opinion.
