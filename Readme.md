## Code Review

### Introduction

Let's start with a little definition. Code review is a review of a piece of code before it is added to the overall source code of an application. This review aims to detect (among other things) non-compliance with best practices, architectural weaknesses, forgotten "dead code" ... Code review is a fairly common practice in development. This practice can be implemented regardless of the size of the teams. Having an effective code review policy is time consuming and may seem at first glance to be an unnecessary cost. However, it offers many advantages, some directly visible, others more latent:

- The quality of the code is obviously improved, it becomes more maintainable, better architected...
- As mentioned above, the number of bugs is reduced;
- Communication and collaboration between team members is increased;
- Reading code has a formative effect on the project team;
- The knowledge of the project is correctly spread over the whole team.
