Elements that we could do differently next time in order to produce better results :

- Use a planning management tool like Trello to better organize the distribution of tasks and the gestion of our branches.
- Naming our branches without putting our names in it but only the name of the feature/task corresponding to the branch.
- Better organize the team to avoid loosing time on merging by waiting the other members of the team.

Instead of that, we had a great communication in the team and our git standards have permit us to produce a qualitative result in the required deadline
